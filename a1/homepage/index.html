			 <h3>Overview</h3>
			 <p>Born on the 11th of February of 1996. Currently studying Computer Science at University of Crete. Web designer, Photographer, Video Maker.</p>

				 <h4>Web Design</h4>
       			 <p>I created my first website back in 2011, in the age of 13. One day I got an idea to create a website that would contain everything I loved: music and games. At first the music page was filled with YouTube music videos and the gaming page was full of mini-games found on major online gaming websites.</p>
       			 <p>Roughly two years later, the next version of the website came up on my mind. The YouTube videos turned to an online music player and the mini-games were written off. Gaming videos and guides took their place.</p>
				 <p>Viclec.com is just a memory now. After puberty ended, I decided that there's no reason at all maintaining a website like this, without purpose. Until this day I have designed several websites along with the website of our family company (which happens to be my favorite one): <a href="http://www.multi.gr">www.multi.gr</a></p>

				 <h4>Photography</h4>
       			 <p>Like many people I liked photography since I was a child, but I took the extra step of making it one of my main activities on 2013, when I bought my first reflex camera. I shortly realised that I loved spotting airplanes and I got into a club of planespotters in Heraklion. Apart from planes I love photographing animals, landscapes and generally nature -like a normal person. </p>

				 <h4>Video Production</h4>
       			 <p>I'm the definition of an amateur, when it comes to video making. I started making gaming videos on YouTube and after that (and until this single day) I started making VLOGs about my travels. In the future I would like to start making short films.</p>

			   <h4 id="future">The Future</h4>
			   <p>I'm currently on my 3rd year in CSD. If everything goes as planned, I will graduate in four semesters. I would like to do a Master afterwards, in case I find a suitable matter to continue on. In other case I will work for our family buisiness, or I could even start my own company.</p>
